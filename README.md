# Easy Character Sheet

This project hopes to solve the issues I've had with character sheets when I play DnD.  I don't like keeping physical paper as it's easier to lose and the online resources I've used have been finnicky and are not always free or don't offer storage.

To solve those problems I've built this app, which uses React, Redux, Firebase Auth, Firestore NoSQL, and SASS.
